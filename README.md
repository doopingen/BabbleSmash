# BabbleSmash-Unit2-GA
This is my unit2 project for General Assembly. This app is a proof of concept, with full user authentication/authorization, that takes a URL submitted by user and renders it using a data science API. the returned information would then include content tags, sentiment analysis, text summarization, charts, graphs and supplemental article info via additional API queries.
