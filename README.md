# BabbleSmash-Unit2-GA

**Introduction**

This is my unit2 project for General Assembly. This app is a proof of concept, with full user authentication/authorization, that takes a URL submitted by user and renders it using a data science API. the returned information would then include content tags, sentiment analysis, text summarization, charts, graphs and supplemental article info via additional API queries.

**Foundation**

This project was built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and Pug. At the heart and soul of this program is a Data Science API from [Yonder Labs](yonderlabs.com)

**Inspiration**

The inspiration for this project came from a conversation that I had with a friend. "How can we extract knowledge from an article as fast as humanly possible? The fuggin computer can do everything for us as it is, it should be able to read and summarize an article for us as well." That drunken conversation was put to the test here and "BabbleSmash" was born. 

**User experience, wireframing and the "Smash" process**

I did my best to design the experience using a variety of inspiration that I've accumulated over the years. In a nutshell:

* User Registers for use using a call to action on home page
* They are taken to a profile page where they can see run their URL through the "Smashbar". The profile page is their homepage on the site and contains all the information and resources they will need to use the service
* The user will have full CRUD functionality and data will not be stored on the service unless they specifically save it.
